# Movie E-commerce Website

This is a modern e-commerce website that allows customers to browse movies, add them to a cart, and complete a purchase. The website is built using React on the front end and Spring on the back end. It utilizes the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie data.
